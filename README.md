# ENSO

## about
This is a small project that I intend to maintain as a way for me to quickly get up and running with new meteor projects

## how to use
- clone this repo
- run `meteor npm install`
- copy `settings.example.json` to `settings.json`
- change `MONGO_URL` in `settings.json` to the connection string you want to use (such as atlas) 
- run `meteor` or `meteor run` or `meteor run -p 4000`
- run `deploy.bat` or `deploy.sh` depending on you systems architecture to auto deploy to galaxy hosting
